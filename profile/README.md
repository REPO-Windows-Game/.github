## 🧠 Overview  

**R.E.P.O.** is a tense cooperative extraction horror experience focused on risk, coordination, and survival under pressure. Players enter hostile locations to retrieve valuable objectives while avoiding unpredictable threats that punish careless movement and poor communication.

Gameplay emphasizes teamwork and awareness. Every action—opening doors, moving objects, or navigating tight spaces—can draw attention. Success depends on reading the environment, sharing information, and making smart decisions when plans inevitably go wrong.

The atmosphere is deliberately oppressive. Limited visibility, reactive enemies, and minimal UI reinforce vulnerability and heighten suspense. Sessions are designed to be unpredictable, ensuring that no two runs feel the same.

R.E.P.O. delivers compact, high-intensity missions where survival hinges on cooperation and composure.
